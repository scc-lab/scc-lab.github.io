bio: graduated in 2019 with a first-class honors bachelorâ€™s degree in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Benin, Nigeria.  During his undergraduate degree, he worked as a research assistant in Azura Lab at the University of Benin Nigeria where he carried out the design and analysis of an all-terrain vehicle(ATV). He is passionate about the mechanical design of autonomous systems, reinforcement learning, and control theory. He worked briefly as a software engineer after his undergraduate study, and he is currently a Ph.D. student at Oklahoma State University under the supervision of Dr. Rushikesh Kamalapurkar who directs the Systems, Cognition, and Control Laboratory. His research is on using control theory to develop new stability-aware reinforcement learning techniques for safety-critical autonomous systems. As well as the development of learning techniques that are geared towards robotic systems that exhibit nonsmooth phenomena, where policy synthesis is particularly challenging.
