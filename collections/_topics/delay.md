For nonlinear systems, controllers considering constant and time-varying state delays have been available. However, nonlinear results considering delayed inputs are far less prevalent, especially for systems with model uncertainties and/or disturbances. Predictor-based techniques have been extended to nonlinear systems with time-varying delays in the state and/or the input; however, these results requires knowledge of the plant dynamics and assumed that the plant is disturbance-free. Capitalizing on recent developments regarding control of nonlinear systems with known constant input delays, we developed control methods for systems with known and unknown state and input delays. The delay-tolerant controllers were applied to counter fatigue-induced actuation delays in neuromuscular electrical stimulation based feedback control of the knee joint.
