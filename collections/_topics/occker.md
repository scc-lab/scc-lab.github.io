title: Occupation kernels and Liouville operators
weight: 8
description: Operator theoretic methods for data-driven identification, verification, and control synthesis.

The key idea here is the use of trajectories (i.e., time-series) as the fundamental unit of data for the resolution of control synthesis and certification problems in dynamical systems. Trajectory information in the dynamical systems is embedded in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) through what will be called occupation kernels. The occupation kernels are tied to the dynamics of the system through the densely defined Liouville operator. The pairing of Liouville operators and occupation kernels results in an operator theoretic framework that allows for nontrivial information concerning the dynamical systems to be extracted from the RKHS.
