In this proposal, we focus on alteration of the activation pattern of knee muscles (hamstrings, quadriceps, and gastrocnemius) to minimize joint contact forces, and thereby, to delay the onset and slow down the progression of knee osteoarthritis. We will develop non-invasive transcutaneous stimulation methods capable of subtly changing the muscle activation patterns during walking using joint angle and/or electromyography feedback.
