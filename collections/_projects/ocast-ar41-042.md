A key challenge for the development of energy-saving HVAC strategies is the lack of understanding of dynamic response of HVAC units at a time scale of seconds and minutes. Existing building energy models also significantly under-predict the actual building energy utilization and are being updated to account for building and unit variability. These updated standards will necessitate an understanding of unit dynamic response, ideally in a reduced-order fashion, that can be utilized to map unit performance across a wide range of conditions.
